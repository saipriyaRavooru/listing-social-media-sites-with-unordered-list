Styling Details
Headings (h2 to h5) use 'Gill Sans' font family, 50px font size, and a light green color (rgb(135, 223, 141)).

Background color is teal (rgb(9, 149, 149)) with a background image (images/media.jpg) blended using lighten mode.

Links are styled by default browser styles, with target="_blank" to open externally.

Folder Structure

Future Improvements

Make the layout responsive and accessible.

Use external CSS for better style management.

Include icons next to each app for visual appeal.
